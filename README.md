# MIDI Tools for M8C

## Introduction
This is a set of MIDI tools to use with [M8C running on a Raspberry Pi with Patchbox OS](https://github.com/RowdyVoyeur/m8c-rpi4). These tools have been customised to use the Korg nanoKONTROL as a controller for the M8 and to change the audio routing between the M8, MC-101 and Audio In.
